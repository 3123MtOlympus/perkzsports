# Perkzofwerk Sports Team Training Program Landing Page

## Overview
The **Perkzofwerk Sports Team Training Program** landing page is designed to provide users with information about the program and allow them to sign up for team practices. The program offers adults the chance to experience the camaraderie, accountability, and structure of a sports team, focusing on conditioning and rebuilding athleticism, but without the competition of games.

## Features
- **Program Description**: Detailed information about the program, emphasizing its benefits for former athletes who want to reconnect with team dynamics.
- **Sign-up Form**: Allows users to submit personal information, including name, email, phone number, and a message about why they’re joining.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the page and form.
- **CSS**: Styles the page for a clean, modern look.
- **JavaScript/Backend (optional)**: For handling form submissions and other interactive elements.

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
- A web browser to view the HTML page.
- A server (optional) if you want to process form submissions, collect data, or send notifications.

### Steps to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the landing page.

### Form Submission:
To handle form submissions, you will need a back-end server:
- Set up a server using **Node.js/Express**, **PHP**, or other technologies.
- Configure the form’s `action` attribute to point to your server endpoint.
  Example:
  ```html
  <form action="/submit-signup" method="POST">
  ```
  
### Backend Implementation (Future Goal):
1. **Database Integration**:
   - Store user sign-up data in a database (e.g., **MongoDB**, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**).
   - Each sign-up will save user information such as name, email, phone number, and message.

2. **Email and Text Notifications**:
   - Implement a notification system that sends email and/or text notifications to users confirming their registration.
   - Use services like **SendGrid** or **Twilio** for email and SMS notifications.

3. **Payment Collection**:
   - Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., **Stripe**, **PayPal**) to collect fees for team membership or practice sessions.
   - Ensure the payment form is secure with HTTPS and proper validation.

4. **Team Stats and Awards Tracking**:
   - Add features to track team performance, individual progress, and conditioning results.
   - Display team stats and milestones on a dedicated section of the site.
   - Implement a system to assign and display awards for participation or performance.

## Future Goals
- **Backend Database**: Implement a full back-end server with database support to store user data, track team stats, and manage sign-ups.
- **Email and Text Notifications**: Automatically notify users when they sign up for a practice session, including reminders before practice.
- **Payment Collection**: Enable payment processing for participation fees, making it easier for users to join practices and events.
- **Team Stats and Awards**: Create a system to track team progress, assign awards, and highlight participant achievements.
- **User Profiles**: Implement a member login system where users can view their progress, practice attendance, and payment history.

## Customization
You can easily modify the content, styling, or form fields:
- **Content**: Update the program description to fit your exact message.
- **CSS**: Modify the styles in the `<style>` block in the HTML file to customize colors, fonts, or layout.
- **Form**: Add or remove input fields depending on the information you need to collect.
